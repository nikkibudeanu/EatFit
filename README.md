# Features 

## HOME PAGE
The main page of EAT+FIT consists of a navigation bar, a menu of the day which changes on a daily basis, explore section and the footer. When arrived on EAT+FIT, you will first see the main video and a welcome message.

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is featured on all 6 pages. The navigation bar will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without the need to use the ‘back’ button. It includes links to all 6 pages and a logo(created by me). It is identical on all pages in order to ensure consistency and a positive user experience.
